# Introduction
（1）、The source code is shown in  the folder 'code', which contains the source codes of 
image segmentation, SIFT detection and image stitching. The code is written in C++ or matlab version.
（2）、The are several video demos that directly show the results of this projects, please refer to the folder 'video demonstration'
and then click on the  .mp4 files.
（3）、Finally, if you are intersested in the theoretical analysis of this project, please refer to the pdf  files
'Adaptive Dehaze Method for Aerial Image Processing.pdf', 'Poster demonstration.pdf' and 'PowerPoint demonstration.pdf'.
